## About <a name = "about"></a>

An app built entirely in React which showcases different beers from Brewdog. Built using PunkAPI, an open-source API of Brewdog beers. The list of beers has been mapped to the interface, and can be searched through via a searchbox, and filtered using checkboxes. The beers can be filtered by the classics range, high ABV content, and high acidity. Only one filter can be applied at a time. A beer can be clicked on to access more information about it through routing to a new page. The Card component and the FilterItem component have been tested using the React Testing Library.
